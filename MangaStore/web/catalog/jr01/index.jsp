   On an Earth-like super-continent planet, strange monsters have been mysteriously appearing 
   and causing disasters resulting in the world's superheroes rising to combat them alongside 
   the local supervillains. Saitama, the protagonist of the series, is the strongest hero alive 
   in the entire franchise, hailing from the metropolis of City Z who easily defeats the monsters 
   or other villains with a single punch to the point where monsters just explode when struck. 
   However, due to his immeasurable strength, Saitama has become bored with his power and is constantly 
   trying to find stronger opponents who can present a challenge to him.
