A powerful fox known as the Nine-Tails attacks the ninja village Konoha. In response, 
the leader of Konoha ? the Fourth Hokage - seals the fox inside his newborn son Naruto Uzumaki 
at the cost of his life. As a child, Naruto is isolated from the Konoha community, who regards 
him as if he was the Nine-Tails itself. A decree made by the current Hokage, the Third Hokage, 
forbids anyone mentioning the Nine-Tails to anyone else.
